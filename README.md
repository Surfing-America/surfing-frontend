### Conflict Plan

* *What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?*
  * Ryan volunteered to resolve conflict with a patient and understanding neutral perspective. And if Ryan is the problem, the whole team will work as a cohesive unit to attack swiftly and mercilessly to end the threat as effectively as possible.

* *What will the team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other mambers contribute?*
  * We will approach the individual as a team, or elect a single representative to engage the solo worker and engage in a discussion that emphasizes the importance of teamwork.

* *How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?*
  * Try your best, but if you feel if you don't think you're getting things done, then bring it up sooner rather than later. Ask each other for a "second eye" when you feel like you've been staring at something too long. Don't be afraid to level set, break it down barney style, draw it out, ask the question several different ways to figure out the missing link.

* *How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?*
  * We will have 1-on-1 discussion. Responsbility will fall upon the individual who notices it first to bring up the issue immediately.

* *How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?*
  * Should all attempts at a peaceful resolution fail, speed and violence of action will be the ultimate checkmate. But we could probably call in some help from Audrey before we resort to violence.
